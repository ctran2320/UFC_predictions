# UFC Predictions
## Background/Goal:
Last August of 2022, I started a dessert catering side-business that I do on the weekends to make extra money on the side and have something fun I can do on the weekends! I've had many orders since then, sold thousands of dessert cups and various other items and have made decent money that offsets a lot of monthly spending so I can save most of my salary from my W-2 job. I created a Tableau Dashboard to track my performance in terms of profit, revenue, number of orders and can let me see any trends or if I'm meeting my goals. It also provides useful information about my best selling items and my highest expense items for ingredients and supplies, which tells me which flavors I can recommend people when they ask for recommendations or offer deals on those items. I can also look for deals/coupons on my expensive ingredients/supplies or look for places to buy in bulk.

I also wanted to practice my SQL knowledge/ability and answer 10 questions that a potential manager/business owner may ask of me. In this case, I'm my own boss so I explored questions that seemed interesting to me and answered them via SQL & Python.
